 CuPED Acknowledgements

CuPED was originally developed by Christopher Cox <christopher.cox@ualberta.ca>
and Andrea Berez <andrea.berez@gmail.com>.  The contributions of the following
individuals to CuPED development also deserve acknowledgement:

    * Kristina Geeraert <geeraert@ualberta.ca> - Dinka transcripts
    * Stephanie Morse <theizit@gmail.com> - CuPED artwork
    * Sally Rice <sally.rice@ualberta.ca> - Dene Suline transcripts

The Qt interface to CuPED uses icons from the 'circular' icon theme, developed
by Ben Gillbanks and distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.5
Generic license (cf. bin/icons/circular/README); and others from the 'tango'
icon set, developed by contributors to the Tango Project and released under a
Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5 Generic license (cf. bin/icons/
tango/README).  While CuPED gratefully acknowledges its use of these resources,
this should not be taken to indicate in any way an endorsement of CuPED by
these other developers.

CuPED also makes use of several external pieces of software to process
transcript media and templates.  Several of these programs are bundled with
CuPED in binary distributions:
