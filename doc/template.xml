            <!-- The type of this variable. -->
            <!-- Possible values are:
                * 'directory': some number of directories.

                * 'file': some number of files.
                    - Option: 'fileType': Restrict the range of file types
                      which the user can select.  Possible values are:
                        * 'image': any CuPED-supported image format;
                        * 'audio': any CuPED-supported audio format;
                        * 'video': any CuPED-supported video format;
                        * 'av': any CuPED-supported audio or video format;
                        * 'transcript': any CuPED-supported transcript format.

               * 'transcript': some number of CuPED-supported transcripts.
                  (This differs from a 'file' with a 'fileType' of
                  'transcript', in that this will attempt to parse the
                  provided transcript, not just confirm its type)

               * 'string': Some number of strings of characters.
                    - Option: 'minLength': Require all strings provided by
                      the user to have a specific minimum length (in
                      characters).  Possible values are any positive integer
                      less than or equal to 'maxLength'.
                    - Option: 'maxLength': Require all strings provided by
                      the user to have a specific maximum length (in
                      characters).  Possible values are any positive integer
                      greater than or equal to 'minLength'.

               * 'colour', 'color': some number of colours.  Each colour is
                  represented as a six-character string of hexadecimal digits
                  of the form 'rrggbb', where 'rr', 'gg', and 'bb' stand for
                  the red, green, and blue (RGB) values which comprise the
                  colour.

               * 'font': Some number of fonts.

               * 'tier': Some number of tiers from among those named in the
                  list specified by 'range'.  ('range' is expected to evaluate
                  to a list of Transcript objects)

               * 'selection': Select some number of options among those
                  specifeid in 'range'.  ('range' is expected to evaluate to
                  a list of triples, each having the form (display_name,
                  display_description, value))

            <!-- (Optional) Options which qualify the behaviour of the -->
            <!-- given selection type.  Options recognized for all variable -->
            <!-- types are:
                * 'minSelection': the minimum number of items which must be
                   provided or selected by the user for this variable.  If
                   not specified, this defaults to 1 (at least one item has
                   to be selected).  Possible values are any non-negative
                   integer, less than or equal to 'maxSelection'.

                * 'maxSelection': the maximum number of items which must be
                   provided or selected by the user for this variable.  If
                   not specified, this defaults to 1 (at most one item).
                   Possible values are any non-negative integer, greater than
                   or equal to 'minSelection'.

                * 'isConstant': is this variable a constant which the user
                   should neither be prompted to supply values for, nor
                   permitted to modify?  If not specified, this defaults to
                   False (this variable is not a constant).  Possible values
                   are 'True' and 'False'.

                * 'isOrdered': is the order of selected items meaningful in
                   this variable?  If not specified, this defaults to False
                   (the order is not significant).  Possible values are
                   'True' and 'False'.

                * 'isRequired': is the user required to provide a non-None
                   value for this variable?  If not specified, this defaults
                   to True (a value must be provided).  Possible values are
                   'True' and 'False'.
