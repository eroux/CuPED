 CuPED TODO

 - General:

    * Remove references to 'eval' and 'exec' throughout.  (Some refactoring,
      restructuring of the template file structure likely required for this;
      see item on nested variables)

    * Allow for nested variables.  (This should address many of the problems
      currently faced with tracking variable dependencies, as well as reducing
      the need to rely on calls to 'eval' / 'exec')

    * Fix handling of 'maxSelection' / 'minSelection' in templates.  It should
      be possible to have no upper or lower limit to the number of items
      selected; consider adding this possibility with a special interpretation
      of negative values for these options

    * Improve in-code documentation throughout (docstrings, etc.)

    * Add unit tests to all core classes

    * Consider methods for internationalization / localization

    * Allow multiple media files to be loaded with a single transcript (as
      requested by Naomi Fox; in general, media file handling could stand
      to be improved)

    * Fix bug reported by Daniel Kaufman <dak37@cornell.edu>, where certain
      ELAN transcripts are not loaded properly.

 - src/cuped:

    * Fill 'transcript.overlapping_annotations' (currently empty; should
      be filled by all subclasses of 'Transcript')

    * Improve the 'ffmpeg_avtools.py' implementation: add progress callbacks,
      use 'yamdi' for FLV postprocessing, allow users to specify one or two-
      pass video processing, more detailed access to media format-specific
      processing options

        @ More generally, rethink the 'avtools' interface and the options it
          exposes to the user and the functions it needs to provide to be of
          use to its callers

    * Optionally read in ELAN '.pfsx' files for default tier display values

 - src/cli:

    * OSX: fix build to allow for command-line usage from within CuPED.app
      (currently not working; apparent class-path issues)

    * Fix prompting for multiple values (currently disabled)

    * If the media associated with an ELAN transcript can't be loaded,
      let the user know (and ideally prompt him/her to provide the location
      of the relevant files)

 - src/qt:

    * Prompt the user to save their template when 'Done' is clicked (if the
      template hasn't already been saved)

    * Allow the user to specify a name for the template file being saved.
      (This would help us avoid the situation of having $n$ completed
       templates in the template list, all named "Basic Template")

    * Improve the layout of 'CuPEDWizardCustomizeTier'.  This widget resizes
      poorly, with the centre list occupying less space than it ideally
      should

    * If the media associated with an ELAN transcript can't be loaded,
      let the user know (and ideally prompt him/her to provide the location
      of the relevant files)

    * Move acknowledgements into a separate (HTML) file

    * Upgrade to (Py)Qt 4.5, then remove all restrictions upon wizard window
      height (assuming that the cause of window size problems under win32 is
      due to the bug reported fixed in Qt 4.5)
